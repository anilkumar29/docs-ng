# Troubleshooting

Sync Gateway is alpha software, which means the developers are hungy for feedback about it. If you run into any roadblocks, please let us know by filing an issue on one of our projects or via the mailing list. What seems insignificant to you may be hitting everyone but the core developers, so until you let us know, we can't fix it.
